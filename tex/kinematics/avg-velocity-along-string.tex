\begin{xca}[{Irodov~\cite[1.2]{irodovProblems}}]
A point traversed half the distance with a velocity $v_{0}$. The
remaining part of the distance was covered with velocity $v_{1}$ for
half the time, and with velocity $v_{2}$ for the other half of the
time. Find the mean velocity of the point averaged over the whole time
of motion.
\end{xca}

\begin{soln}
\IDENTIFY
Lets write down all the quantities:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\ell$ be the unknown total distance
\item $\Delta t = \Delta t_{0} + 2\Delta t_{1}$ be the unknown time interval for the total trajectory
\item $\Delta t_{0}$ be the unknown time interval for the point to
traverse the first half of the trajectory
\item $v_{0}$ be the unknown velocity traversed over a distance of $\ell/2$
\item $v_{1}$ be the unknown velocity traversed over the time interval $\Delta t_{1}$
\item $v_{2}$ be the unknown velocity traversed over the time interval
$\Delta t_{1}$ (not a typo, it's really $\Delta t_{1}$).
\end{enumerate}
The average velocity we want to find $\bar{v}$ will be equal to $\ell/\Delta t$.

\SETUP
We have
\begin{equation}
   v_{0} = \frac{\ell/2}{\Delta t_{0}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    (v_{1} + v_{2})\Delta t_{1} = \ell/2.
\end{equation}
We will use these equations to write the average velocity
\begin{equation}
    \bar{v} = \frac{\ell}{\Delta t_{0} + 2\Delta t_{1}}
\end{equation}
in terms of the velocities $v_{0}$, $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$.

\EXECUTE
We can now compute from these the time intervals
\begin{equation}
\Delta t_{1} = \frac{\ell}{2(v_{1}+v_{2})}.
\end{equation}
Hence
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\bar{v} &= \frac{\ell}{\Delta t}\\
&= \frac{\ell}{[(\ell/2)/v_{0}] + 2[\ell/(2v_{1}+2v_{2})]}\\
&= \frac{\ell}{[\ell/(2v_{0})] + [\ell/(v_{1}+v_{2})]}\\
&= \frac{1}{[1/(2v_{0})] + [1/(v_{1}+v_{2})]}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Hence
\begin{equation}
\bar{v} = \frac{2v_{0}(v_{1} + v_{2})}{v_{1} + v_{2} + 2v_{0}}.
\end{equation}

\EVALUATE
If the velocity is constant $v_{0}=v_{1}=v_{2}=v$,
then the average velocity is $\bar{v}=2v(v+v)/(v + v + 2v)=4v^{2}/(4v)=v$ as expected.
