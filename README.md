# Introduction

These are my notes on physics. They are mildly pedagogical. Mostly I try
to consider a large number of worked examples, since that's how physics
is done.

Hopefully I'll get to analytical mechanics, and other interesting
fields. I'd like to include numerical analysis software in the notes,
but lets see how far I get.

# "Copyright"

I try to use problems that are interesting to me, and I attempt to cite
the source of the problems otherwise.
